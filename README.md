# Pulse Point Hospital

Pulse Point Hospital is a browser-based management simulation inspired by classic tycoon games. It blends the tongue-in-cheek business juggling of *Biing!* (minus the adult content) with the patient-flow problem solving of *Theme Hospital*. Build rooms, hire staff, invest in research, and keep the reputation of your private clinic soaring.

## Features

- **Hospital construction** – Place receptions, triage desks, pediatrics and maternity suites, orthopedics, neurology, oncology, dialysis, dental surgery, emergency bays, radiology, operating theatres, ICUs, wellness facilities, arcades, and more across a tactical grid.
- **Interactive blueprint grid** – A coordinate-labelled construction sheet shows exactly where builds can go, highlights available plots while you are in build mode, and mirrors placements on the canvas overview.
- **Freeform campus parcels** – Start with the Founders Atrium build zone and purchase adjacent lots to expand construction in any direction, unlocking fresh real estate for specialised wings.
- **Hand-painted 2D floorplan** – A WebCanvas renderer paints every room with bespoke furnishings and animates the patient queue for an at-a-glance view of the hospital flow.
- **Luminous blueprint overview** – The overview canvas now layers glowing blueprint gridlines, soft depth shading, and accent-lit room labels so the hospital feels vibrant while remaining readable.
- **Radiant treatment wings** – Each build pulses with theme-coloured floor sheen, aura glows, and ambience capsules so you can read environment, welfare, and reputation boosts directly from the canvas.
- **Room designer** – Tailor each build with adjustable layouts, themed interiors, specialist machine load-outs, décor boosts, and new amenity add-ons such as snack machines, hydration stations, hanging gardens, and ATM kiosks before you drop it onto the blueprint.
- **Staff management** – Hire doctors, surgeons, nurses, assistants, janitors, facility managers, marketers, technicians, researchers, accountants, midwives, therapists, entertainers, dentists, chefs, and security to keep every wing humming.
- **Facility & grounds care** – Facility managers water plants, clear snack litter, and boost grounds scores while janitors polish interiors so your environment and welfare meters stay high.
- **Morale & fun** – Theme Hospital-inspired clown care, holotheatre cabaret, zen gardens, gourmet kitchens, and gift shops lift patience, morale, and reputation without leaning into *Biing!*’s risqué side.
- **Dynamic patient simulation** – Patients arrive with insurance, credit, cash, and installment profiles, emergency escalations, and treatment needs that map to your available rooms, plus individual patience that ebbs and flows with facilities and policies.
- **Treatment pricing** – Every diagnosis carries its own treatment charge that shifts with equipment upgrades and ambience bonuses so you can preview revenue, deposits, and deferred balances before patients enter the ward.
- **Equipment progression** – Invest in advanced machines to raise room severity capacity and unlock lucrative treatments as your finances grow.
- **Billing & finance** – Track invoices in a rolling ledger, monitor real-time revenue/expense summaries, take bank loans with scheduled repayments, and follow up on patients who defer balances through installment plans.
- **Policies & objectives** – Toggle overtime and fast-track policies while completing milestone goals.
- **Research & marketing** – Fund projects to unlock upgrades and launch campaigns to influence demand.
- **Ambience & welfare scoring** – Decorations, live plants, and amenities feed into environment, grounds, and patient welfare ratings that directly influence patience, morale, and payout bonuses.

## Getting started

1. Open `index.html` in a modern browser (Chromium, Firefox, Safari, or Edge).
2. Use the slim left-hand **Functions** rail to jump between Overview, Build, Staff, Research, and Marketing. The contextual **Options** stack beneath it surfaces the key panels for the active screen (policies, finances, grounds, designer, roster, and more) without crowding the main view—select any shortcut to highlight that panel in the control column. Pick a room on the Build tab, configure its size, theme, equipment, décor, and amenities in the designer, then click a highlighted tile (use the top-left corner) on the blueprint grid to place it. Buy additional parcels from the Hospital Grounds panel to unlock more buildable space. The hospital opens with ¤150,000 on hand so you can expand steadily into advanced treatment wings.
3. Monitor the Finance & Billing panel on the Overview tab to trigger loans when expansion cash is tight and to review active installments. Keep an eye on the animated canvas, event log, billing ledger, and daily report to balance care quality, cashflow, and reputation.

No build step is required; everything runs client-side.
